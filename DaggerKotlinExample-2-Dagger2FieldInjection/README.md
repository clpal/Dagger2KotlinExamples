 # --------Example 2---------
Sample example 2 Field Injection. 
Field injection is mainly used to inject variables into Android framework types that the system instantiates and on which we canâ€™t do constructor injection, like activities, BroadcastReceivers and fragments.

  Field Injection ->@ Component ->@Inject
 # 1  fun injectFields(mainActivity: MainActivity)
Component  comment create context of interface in MainActvity class

 # 2 DaggerCarInjector.create().injectFields(this)
 retrive context of Injector class @ Component in MainActvity class 
# 3@Inject lateinit var hondaCar: Car  
member or field inject in mainactvity  and lateinit private memeber could not be use
# call method using the field refrence
